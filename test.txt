(1) BASIC DATA INFORMATION:

    The loaded set includes abundance (or frequency) data from 4 communities
    and a total of 58 distinct species.

   (Number of observed individuals in each community)       n1 = 168

   (Number of observed species in one community)            D1 = 26

   (Number of observed shared species in two communities)   D12 = 15 
                                                            D13 = 16

                                                            D34 = 15

    C24            0.626         0.037         ( 0.556 , 0.703 )

    C04 : A similarity measure of comparing 4 communities using empirical method.
    C14 : A similarity measure of comparing 4 communities based on equal sample size among all communities.
    C14*: A similarity measure of comparing 4 communities based on equal-effort sample size among all communities.
    C24 : A similarity measure of comparing 4 communities based on shared information between any two communities.
    
    Confidence Interval: Based on an improved bootstrap percentile method. (recommend for use in the case when 
                         similarity is close to 0 or 1 ) 

    Pairwise Comparison:

    C02(3,4)       0.500         0.042         ( 0.417 , 0.583 )

    Average Pairwise = 0.537 

    If the lower bound is less than 0, it is replaced by 0; if the upper bound
       is greater than 1, it is replaced by 1.
